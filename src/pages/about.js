                    I'm a super techie at heart. I am a self taught Developer, with a primary skillset in Full Stack Web Development. 
                    I have built several sites from strictly front end with Angular or React to Full-Stack sites with a Mongo and Node Backend.
                    I am always looking to expand my knowledge and take on a new challenge.
